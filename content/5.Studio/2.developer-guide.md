## Overview

While Cortex Studio provides a comprehensive administrative interface, developers are encouraged to build custom UIs tailored to their specific use cases. Studio's modular architecture makes it an excellent reference implementation for extracting components and patterns.

This guide provides a structured approach to understanding Studio's architecture and building custom analytics interfaces.

- Chart component patterns
- Form patterns and validation
- Layout and navigation patterns

### 3. [API Integration](./5.api-integration.md)
Reactive composables and type-safe patterns for API communication.

**Key Topics:**
- Composable architecture
- Type safety and validation
- Error handling strategies
- Caching and performance

### 4. [UI Components](./6.ui-components.md)
Studio's custom component library for analytics workflows, built on Shadcn/ui and Reka UI.

**Key Topics:**
- Chart and visualization components
- Metric builder components
- Dashboard creation components
- Resource management components
- Component architecture patterns

### 5. [Data Flow](./7.data-flow.md)
Understanding reactive state management and data flow patterns.

**Key Topics:**
- Reactive state architecture
- Component communication patterns
- API data flow
- Form data management
- Performance optimization

## Quick Start Guide

Ready to start building? Follow these steps to extract and adapt Studio patterns for your custom UI:

### 1. Analyze Your Requirements
- Identify the analytics workflows you need to support
- Determine which Studio components align with your use cases
- Plan your component extraction strategy

### 2. Set Up Your Project
- Initialize a Vue.js project with TypeScript support
- Install the necessary dependencies (see Technology Stack)
- Configure your build tools and development environment

### 3. Extract Core Patterns
- Start with the API integration layer (composables)
- Extract the UI components you need
- Adapt the component patterns for your use cases

### 4. Implement Your Features
- Build your custom interfaces using extracted patterns
- Integrate with your specific backend systems
- Add your custom branding and design requirements

### 5. Test and Iterate
- Test your components thoroughly
- Gather user feedback
- Iterate and improve based on real usage

## Technology Stack

Studio is built with a modern technology stack that can be adapted for custom UIs:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Framework** | Nuxt.js 4 | Full-stack Vue.js framework |
| **UI Components** | Shadcn/ui + Reka UI | Modern, accessible component library |
| **Charts** | ECharts | Advanced data visualization |
| **Form Handling** | VeeValidate + Zod | Form validation and schema handling |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first CSS framework |
| **Icons** | Lucide Vue | Consistent iconography |
| **State Management** | Vue Composition API | Reactive state with composables |

## Best Practices

### Component Design
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose
2. **Props Interface**: Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
3. **Event Emission**: Emit events for parent component communication
4. **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Performance**: Optimize for large datasets and complex interactions

### API Integration
1. **Composable Patterns**: Use established composable patterns for API calls
2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error states and recovery
3. **Type Safety**: Maintain strong typing throughout API integration
4. **Caching Strategy**: Cache responses appropriately for performance
5. **Loading States**: Provide visual feedback during async operations

### State Management
1. **Local First**: Keep state as local as possible to components
2. **Reactive Patterns**: Use Vue's reactivity system effectively
3. **Composable Logic**: Extract business logic to reusable composables
4. **Error Boundaries**: Handle errors gracefully with user feedback
5. **Performance**: Optimize reactive state for large datasets
