*Configuring custom rules in Cursor settings*

**To add custom rules:**

1. Open Cursor Settings (Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + J)
2. Go to "General" â†’ "Rules for AI"
3. Add the appropriate prompt below based on your language

When working with Cortex:

1. **Semantic Layer First**: Always think in terms of business metrics, measures, and dimensions rather than raw SQL
2. **Type Safety**: Use Pydantic models extensively for validation and type safety
3. **Multi-Tenant Aware**: Consider workspace and environment context in all operations
4. **API-First**: Design components to work with REST APIs, not direct database access
5. **Vue.js Patterns**: Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns with TypeScript
6. **Component Reusability**: Build components that can be reused across different contexts
7. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and user feedback
8. **Performance**: Consider caching and query optimization in all data operations
9. **Accessibility**: Ensure components are accessible and follow WCAG guidelines
10. **Testing**: Write unit tests for business logic and integration tests for API endpoints

Key Cortex concepts to understand:
- **SemanticMetric**: Core data model for analytics metrics
- **SemanticMeasure**: Quantitative calculations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
- **SemanticDimension**: Categorical data for grouping (dates, categories, etc.)
- **SemanticFilter**: Conditional filtering logic
- **SemanticJoin**: Table relationship definitions
- **SemanticOrderSequence**: Sorting and ordering definitions
- **Workspace**: Top-level organizational unit
- **Environment**: Isolated data and configuration space
- **DataSource**: Database or API connection configuration
- **Dashboard**: Visual representation of metrics and data
- **Consumer**: End-user accessing analytics data
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Python Import Errors**:
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

**Vue Component Issues**:
```bash
# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Database Connection Issues**:
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $CORE_DB_HOST
echo $CORE_DB_NAME
# Test connection
python -c "from cortex.core.stores.database import get_db; print('DB connected')"
```
