Welcome to **Cortex**, a lightweight, modular analytics platform designed to power customer-facing analytics applications.

## What is Cortex?

Cortex is a comprehensive analytics engine built in Python that provides a unified semantic layer for defining business data models, a dynamic query engine that integrates with heterogeneous data sources, and a robust user management systemâ€”all accessible via a FastAPI-powered REST API.

### Core Philosophy

Cortex was built with the following principles in mind:

- **Semantic Abstraction**: Business users should work with meaningful metrics without needing SQL knowledge
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Unified querying across different database types and sources
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clean APIs and extensive type safety for rapid development
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new database connectors and query capabilities
- **AI-Ready**: Designed with AI agent integration in mind for natural language querying

## Key Features

### Semantic Layer
- Define and manage data models in JSON with measures, dimensions, filters, and ordering
- Dynamic schema generation and validation
- Advanced output formatting with IN_QUERY and POST_QUERY transformation modes
- Semantic ordering with intelligent default sorting rules
- Versioning and audit trails for governance

### Query Engine
- Translates semantic definitions into optimized queries across multiple data sources
- Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, SQLite, Oracle, Snowflake, and Redshift
- Real-time output formatting during query execution and post-processing
- Integration with caching for enhanced performance

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Hierarchical organization with workspaces, environments, and consumer groups
- Proper data isolation and environment-level configurations
- Support for multiple organizations with shared infrastructure

### API-First Design
- All functionality exposed via FastAPI-based REST endpoints
- Clear separation of admin and end-user API flows
- Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation with Scalar FastAPI
- Comprehensive request/response validation with Pydantic

### Studio Interface
- Built with Vue.js and Nuxt.js for modern administrative workflows
- Visual interface for configuring workspaces, data sources, and metrics
- Interactive metric builder with real-time preview capabilities
- Dashboard creation with drag-and-drop functionality
- Designed for administrators and data teams to configure analytics foundations

**For Developers**: Studio serves as a reference implementation. Developers are encouraged to build custom UIs tailored to their specific use cases. Learn more about [Studio patterns](../5.Studio/1.overview.md) and [building custom interfaces](../5.Studio/2.developer-guide.md).

### Type Safety & Validation
- Comprehensive Pydantic validation throughout the system
- Runtime type safety and automatic API documentation
- Robust error handling with custom exception hierarchy
- IDE support with extensive type hints

## Use Cases

### Customer-Facing Analytics Platforms
Build white-labeled analytics dashboards for your customers, providing business users with self-service analytics without exposing underlying database complexity.

### Enterprise Data Democratization
Enable business users to access and analyze data through semantic models, reducing dependency on data teams while maintaining proper governance and security.

### Multi-Source Data Integration
Unify data from multiple sources into a single semantic layer, providing consistent business definitions and metrics across different systems and teams.

### AI-Powered Analytics
Foundation for natural language querying and AI-driven insights. The structured semantic models enable AI agents to understand business context and generate intelligent analytics.

### SaaS Analytics Platforms
Perfect for building analytics platforms serving multiple customers with proper data isolation and tenant-specific configurations.

## Architecture Overview
