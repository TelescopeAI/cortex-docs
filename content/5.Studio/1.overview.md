## Overview

Cortex Studio is the administrative interface for the Cortex analytics platform. It provides a centralized environment where administrators and data teams can configure workspaces, manage data sources, build semantic metrics, and create analytics dashboards.

## Purpose & Philosophy

Studio is designed as an **admin-focused configuration tool** rather than an end-user analytics interface. It empowers data teams to:

- Set up and manage organizational workspaces
- Configure data source connections  
- Define semantic metrics and data models
- Build foundational dashboards
- Manage user access and permissions

## Core Capabilities

### Workspace Management
Configure organizational workspaces with isolated environments for development, staging, and production analytics.

### Data Source Integration
Connect to various data sources including databases, data warehouses, and APIs with secure credential management.

### Semantic Layer Configuration
Build and manage the semantic layer through intuitive builders for metrics, dimensions, measures, and relationships.

### Dashboard Creation
Create foundational dashboards with drag-and-drop widgets, chart configurations, and real-time preview capabilities.

## Technology Stack

Studio is built with modern web technologies optimized for administrative workflows:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Framework** | Nuxt.js 4 | Full-stack Vue.js framework |
| **UI Components** | Shadcn/ui + Reka UI | Modern, accessible component library |
| **Charts** | ECharts | Advanced data visualization |
| **Form Handling** | VeeValidate + Zod | Form validation and schema handling |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first CSS framework |
| **Icons** | Lucide Vue | Consistent iconography |
| **State Management** | Vue Composition API | Reactive state with composables |

## Key Features

### Multi-Tenancy Support
- Workspace isolation and environment management
- Role-based access control
- Tenant-specific configurations

### Real-Time Preview
- Live metric execution and testing
- Dashboard preview with sample data
- Query performance monitoring

### Visual Builders
- Drag-and-drop metric configuration
- Interactive chart type selection
- Field mapping with auto-detection

### Developer Experience
- TypeScript throughout the codebase
- Component-based architecture
- Hot module replacement for rapid development

## For Developers

While Studio provides a comprehensive admin interface, **developers are encouraged to build custom UIs** tailored to their specific use cases. Studio serves as a reference implementation and provides:

- **Component Examples**: Reusable Vue components for common analytics patterns
- **API Integration Patterns**: Composables demonstrating API usage
- **Chart Implementations**: ECharts wrappers for various visualization types
- **Form Handling**: Validated forms for metric and dashboard configuration

### Custom UI Development

Studio's modular architecture makes it ideal for extracting components and patterns for custom implementations. Key areas include:

- **Chart Components**: Ready-to-use visualization components
- **Form Builders**: Validated form components for metric configuration  
- **API Composables**: Reactive data fetching and state management
- **UI Patterns**: Consistent design patterns and interactions

## Getting Started

To explore Studio's capabilities:

1. **Set up a Workspace** - Configure your organizational workspace and environments
2. **Connect Data Sources** - Establish connections to your data infrastructure
3. **Build Metrics** - Use the semantic builders to define analytical metrics
4. **Create Dashboards** - Compose dashboards with charts and visualizations
5. **Test & Deploy** - Preview configurations and deploy to production
